---

## üìå Features

- Random number between 1‚Äì100 each round
- 3 Difficulty levels:
  - Easy: 10 attempts
  - Medium: 5 attempts
  - Hard: 3 attempts
- Feedback after each guess ("Too high", "Too low")
- Tracks number of attempts
- Option to play again

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java (Core)
- `Scanner` for input
- `Random` for number generation
- Looping and conditional logic

---

## To run

java GuessingGame

## sample gane play

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
Choose difficulty (easy/medium/hard): medium

Guess a number between 1 and 100. You have 5 attempts.
Enter your guess: 50
Too high!
Enter your guess: 30
Too low!
Enter your guess: 40
Correct! You guessed in 3 attempts.

Play again? (yes/no): no
Thanks for playing!

**# code 2: Student Grade Calculator**

This is a simple **Java console application** that allows users to input marks for any number of subjects, calculates the **total marks**, **average percentage**, and assigns a **grade** based on the percentage.

---

## üìå Features

- Accepts user input for any number of subjects
- Accept total out of marks in each subject
- Calculates:
  - Total marks
  - Average percentage
  - Grade based on percentage
- Displays results in a clean format

---

##  Grading Criteria

| Percentage Range | Grade |
|------------------|-------|
| 90‚Äì100           | A     |
| 80‚Äì89            | B     |
| 70‚Äì79            | C     |
| 60‚Äì69            | D     |
| Below 60         | F     |

 **# code:3 Simple ATM System in Java**

A console-based ATM simulation written in Java. This project demonstrates core object-oriented principles with basic banking functionalities: **check balance**, **deposit**, and **withdraw**.

---

##  Features

- **Secure account simulation** via `BankAccount` class  
- **User interface** through console menu in the `ATM` class  
- **Robust operations**:  
  - Check current balance  
  - Deposit money (only positive amounts)  
  - Withdraw money (with balance validation)  
- **Input validation** for incorrect menu choices or invalid amounts  
- **Clear messaging** on success or failure of transactions

---

## To Run the program:

java ATM

## usage

1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Option 1: Displays your current account balance
Option 2: Prompts for a deposit amount; only positive numbers accepted
Option 3: Prompts for withdrawal; only valid if you have enough balance
Option 4: Exit the ATM simulation

The system loops until you choose to exit.

These three console-based Java projects‚ÄîStudent Grade Calculator, Number Guessing Game, and ATM Interface‚Äîdemonstrate foundational programming skills:

 ..The Grade Calculator shows data processing, arithmetic operations, and results reporting.

 ..The Number Guessing Game is a fun interaction example, using loops, random numbers, and input validation.

 ..The ATM Interface emphasizes object-oriented principles, account management, menu-driven UI, and robust error handling.
